# Spam Detection and Classification with TensorFlow Extended Pipelines

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a spam detection and classification system using TensorFlow Extended (TFX) Pipelines. The system is built to automatically detect and classify emails as spam or ham (non-spam). It employs various machine learning techniques for data preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and deployment.
